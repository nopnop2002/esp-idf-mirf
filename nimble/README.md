# BLE Example   
This is nRF24L01 and BLE gateway application.   
ESP-IDF can use either the ESP-Bluedroid host stack or the ESP-NimBLE host stack.   
The differences between the two are detailed [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/ble/overview.html).   
This project uses the ESP-NimBLE host stack.

Communicate with Arduino Environment.   
I tested it with [this](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-mirf/tree/master/ArduinoCode/Peer-to-peer/StringTest/Receive).   

### Radio to BLE
Receive from Radio and send to BLE.

Communicate with Arduino Environment.   
I tested it with [this](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-mirf/tree/master/ArduinoCode/Peer-to-peer/StringTest/Emitter).   

# Android Application   
I used [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal) app.   

- pair with ESP_NIMBLE_SERVER   

- Launch the app and select device  
	Menu->Devices->Bluetooth LE   

- Long press the device and select the Edit menu

- Select Custom and specify UUID   
	The UUIDs are different for ESP-Bluedroid and ESP-NimBLE.

- Connect to device   
	You can send and receive Radio packets using an Android device.

# iOS Application   
[This](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/bluetooth-v2-1-spp-setup/id6449416841) might work, but I don't have iOS so I don't know.   

# Concurrent connection
Unlike ESP-Bluedroid host stack, ESP-NimBLE host stack allows concurrent connections.   
The maximum number of simultaneous connections is specified here.   
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d1e1182-ed41-4b9e-bc55-bb3c75dd4745)   

You can use multiple smartphones simultaneously.
